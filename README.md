# Slope Limits (WtM)

This is a mod for Cities: Skylines.

The mod adds a button to toggle customized slope limits for roads and rail.

The limits are customizable in the GUI.

## Files

Settings and logs are stored in the directory "ModConfig" in `<DataLocation.localApplicationData>`.
On windows that usually means `<AppData>\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\ModConfig`, where `<AppData>` usually is at `C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData`, where `<UserName>` is the currently logged in user.
So, if your user name is _Gruhimi Klampamejmera_, the files might be in `C:\Users\Gruhimi Klampamejmera\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\ModConfig`.

Settings are stored in `wtmcsConfigurableSlopeLimits.xml`.
When logging to file, logs will be written to `wtmcsConfigurableSlopeLimits.log`.

## Logging

Create the file `wtmcsConfigurableSlopeLimits.debug` in order to enable debug log stuff (wich might slow things down quite a bit).
