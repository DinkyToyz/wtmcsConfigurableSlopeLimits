Allows slope limits to be configured separately for different network types.

The limits can be configured using the options in the content manager (unfortunately the options controls are quite limited, so there's just a bunch of sliders without any display of the numeric values for now), or a configuration file.

In the game the slope limits can be toggled between stricter and looser with this button (near the snap toggle button):

I made this for myself, and use it. Hopefully it works for others as well, but I make no promises.
I also make no promises about updating or fixing things fast, as that depends on how busy I am with work and other stuff.

The config file, wtmcsConfigurableSlopeLimits.xml, is stored in the folder "ModConfig" wherever the game points to with <DataLocation.localApplicationData>. On a Windows system that'd usually be some where like "C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\ModConfig".
